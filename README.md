# CS280proj-Hessian-aware-pruning
This is the course project repo for CS280 at UC Berkeley, Spring 2020. 
It contains our modified version of [Lottery-Ticket-Hypothesis-in-Pytorch](https://github.com/rahulvigneswaran/Lottery-Ticket-Hypothesis-in-Pytorch) and [Pyhessian](https://github.com/amirgholami/PyHessian). 

We provide our proposed Hessian-aware network pruning algorithm in /LTH and corresponding visualization tools in /visualization_results. You should first use the pruning algorithm to prune your network and then use the visualization tool to plot the results. Detailed instructions are stated in the subdirectories respectively.

This work is done by Xing Jin, Xun Lin and Mengze Zhu.
